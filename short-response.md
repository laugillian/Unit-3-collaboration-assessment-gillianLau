# Short Response Questions
1. **If you're collaborating with a classmate whats the first thing that each of the team members need to do? Why is it important to do this step?**

If you're collaborating with a classmate, we would need use make our own separate branches first by using `git branch feature/new-file-name`. It is important to do this step because working in our own branch first can give us an idea of what our main branch would look like and we will also be able to check our partners work to see if they should make any changes to their branch before we put everything in main.

2. **Why do developers use branches?**

Developers use branches to continue working without affecting the main branch and to see if they should make any changes before they combine the branch into main especially when working with another partner.

3. **What is git? What is git hub? How does git and git hub work together?**

Git is a distributed version control system where every developer has access to all changes and its also what they use to take a snapshot of what the code looks like at the moment.

Git hub is a cloud based service that allows developers to store, track, manage, and control changes to their code.

Git hub and git work together by making it easier to help us organize our codebase and make coding easier.

4. **What is wrong with the following command sequence? What should be the correct command sequence?

The command sequence is out of order, the first two steps should be flipped with git add . being first and git commit -m " " being 2nd and it should look like this: 
`git add .`
`git commit -m "saving work"`
`git push`
